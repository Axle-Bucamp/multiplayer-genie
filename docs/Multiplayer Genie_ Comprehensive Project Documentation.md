The networking layer implements sophisticated synchronization mechanisms that ensure consistent game state across all connected clients while minimizing latency and bandwidth requirements. The system utilizes a combination of authoritative server architecture and client-side prediction to provide responsive gameplay while maintaining security and preventing cheating.

### Core Components

#### Spherical World Model Manager

The Spherical World Model Manager serves as the central authority for spatial management within the multiplayer environment. This component implements geodesic coordinate systems that enable efficient calculation of distances, directions, and spatial relationships between players and environmental elements. The spherical model provides several key advantages over traditional Cartesian coordinate systems including natural handling of global positioning, elimination of edge cases at world boundaries, and efficient proximity queries using great-circle distance calculations.

The manager implements sophisticated spatial indexing algorithms that enable rapid identification of nearby players and environmental elements. These algorithms utilize the mathematical properties of spherical geometry to provide O(log n) complexity for proximity queries, enabling efficient operation even with large numbers of simultaneous players. The spatial indexing system supports dynamic updates as players move through the environment, maintaining optimal performance characteristics regardless of player distribution patterns.

The component also provides advanced spawn point management that ensures balanced and fair player distribution across the game environment. The spawn point algorithms consider factors such as current player density, strategic importance of different regions, and historical usage patterns to select optimal spawn locations that enhance gameplay balance and player experience.

#### AI Context Assembler

The AI Context Assembler represents one of the most sophisticated components in the system, responsible for creating comprehensive contextual information that enables AI agents to make intelligent decisions in complex multiplayer environments.

def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt

def verify_token(credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Depends(security)):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(credentials.credentials, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        if username is None:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
                detail="Could not validate credentials"
            )
        return payload
    except jwt.PyJWTError:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Could not validate credentials"
        )

def require_role(required_role: str):
    def role_checker(token_data: dict = Depends(verify_token)):
        user_role = token_data.get("role")
        if user_role != required_role and user_role != UserRole.ADMIN:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Insufficient permissions"
            )

            if hasattr(record, 'session_id'):
                log_entry['session_id'] = record.session_id
            
            return json.dumps(log_entry)
    
    def info(self, message, **kwargs):
        extra = {k: v for k, v in kwargs.items()}
        self.logger.info(message, extra=extra)
    
    def error(self, message, **kwargs):
        extra = {k: v for k, v in kwargs.items()}
        self.logger.error(message, extra=extra)
    
    def warning(self, message, **kwargs):
        extra = {k: v for k, v in kwargs.items()}
        self.logger.warning(message, extra=extra)
