# Multiplayer Genie Project Analysis

## Repository Information
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Axle-Bucamp/multiplayer-genie
- **Description**: A multiplayer version of open Google Genie with docs and etc
- **Status**: Public repository with 1 star, 0 forks
- **Commits**: 5 commits total
- **Branches**: 1 (main)

## Project Overview
The project aims to build a **Networking Multiplayer Mode for Google Genie** using a spherical world model concept.

### Core Concept
- Uses a **spherical world model** (like a snowball) as the central environment
- Each player interacts with the same shared universe
- Player perspective determines what part of the world they "see"
- Genie handles video output generation per player considering movement, nearby players, and cooperative dynamics

### Key Features Described

#### World Model: Snowball as Spatial Anchor
- Central world sphere (snowball) as environment
- Player init images generated based on sphere perspective
- Spawn logic tied to keypoints/regions on sphere surface
- Supports 360Â° movement, global positioning, relative orientation

#### Player State & Syncing
Each player maintains:
```json
{
  "id": "player_id",
  "position": [x, y, z],
  "rotation": [rx, ry, rz],
  "last_action": "move_left | attack | interact | idle",
  "init_image": "<base64-encoded>",
  "view_vector": [vx, vy, vz]
}
```

#### Action Pipeline
1. **Player Input**: Action, position, rotation, previous frame
2. **Server Aggregation**: Compute nearby players within render distance
3. **AI Context Assembly**: Custom prompt context per player for Genie
4. **AI Output**: Genie renders next frame/video with nearby player animations
5. **Server Update**: Global state updates for persistent universe

### Identified Challenges
- **Latency**: Needs interpolation/prediction
- **Render Distance**: Compute optimization
- **AI Hallucination**: Long-term consistency management
- **World Model Scaling**: Spatial indexing for large player counts

## Comprehensive TODO Analysis (2025 Roadmap)

### Architecture Overview
- **Visualizer**: Genie (Open Genie GitHub) as world and event renderer
- **Backend**: Nakama (WebSocket, Go/TS) or FastAPI+Nginx+WebSocket+Pydantic (Python)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes & Docker for deployment; Cloud-managed DBs and scalable node pools (GCP/AWS/Azure)
- **Dataset & AI Training**: Mario Bros. coop-inspired multiplayer traces, continuous model training & loss monitoring

### Critical Components (Priority: Critical)
