### Technical Implementation

#### Model Architecture
- Multiple model widths available: 1x, 2x, 3x
- PyTorch-based implementation (pinned to torch==1.9.0 for reproducibility)
- Supports both behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning approaches

#### Training Approaches

##### 1. Behavioral Cloning (BC) Models
- **Foundational Models**: Trained across all videos in single training run
- **House Building Models**: Refined using housebuilding contractor data
- **Early Game Models**: Refined using early game video subset
- More general than RL models but less environment-interactive

##### 2. Reinforcement Learning Models
- **RL from Foundation**: Further refined with reward function for diamond pickaxe acquisition
- **RL from House**: House-based model + RL refinement
- **RL from Early Game**: Early game model + RL refinement
- Less general but excel at progressing through tech tree quickly

#### Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM)
- Predicts what actions player is taking in video recording
- Includes demo code for running IDM on contractor recordings
- Uses .mp4 video files with associated .jsonl action files

### Dataset Collection Strategy

#### Contractor Demonstrations
- Multiple recorder versions (6.x, 7.x, 8.x+)
- Structured data collection with specific prompts
- Version 6.x: Core recorder features
- Version 7.x: Emphasis on early game data (first 30 minutes valuable)
- Version 8.x: House Building from Scratch Task

#### Data Requirements
- At least 12 recordings needed for fine-tuning with default settings
- Contractor data includes .mp4 video files and .jsonl action files
- Early game data especially valuable (first 30 minutes of gameplay)

### Technical Limitations Noted
- Behavioral cloning code trains single step at a time (no error propagation through timesteps)
- Computes gradients one sample at a time for memory efficiency
- Designed for consumer hardware (8GB VRAM)
- Not exact recreation of original VPT paper experiments
